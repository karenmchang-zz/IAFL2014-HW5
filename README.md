\f0\fs24 \cf0 Homework05 - Skanect!\
\
This assignment was based on our first time working with Skanect - 3D Scanning using a Kinect camera. \
\
My self portrait scan turned out well in the program Skanect, however the number of faces had to be brought down due to the limitations of the program on the specific computer used. Even though the model is very low-poly, I find that it still resembles me. (which is pretty great)\
\
My edits in OpenSCAD is really simple. I originally wanted to give myself a little crown using a for loop. But in while programming that in, I wanted to give myself a thought bubble. It would be a bizarre print because there would have to be support material for the bubble, but I thought it would be a funny thing to have some low-poly version of me, thinking a lot. \
\
The only problem I run into is exporting the stl back out. I run into an error, \'93
\f1 Object isn't a valid 2-manifold!\'94 
\f0 Upon some Google-ing, I found that my model may not be \'93watertight.\'94 \
This has been an issue since the beginning since the original scan stl needed a lot of clean up before OpenSCAD would render the import. \
As a result, I am unsure about the best way to solve this error. \
:( \
\
Will attempt a fix and update!}
